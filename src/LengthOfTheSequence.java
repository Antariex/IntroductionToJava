/**
 The length of the sequence

 For its input, the program gets a sequence of non-negative integers; each integer is written on a separate line.
 The sequence ends with an integer 0; when the program reads 0, it should end its work and output the length of the
 sequence (not counting the final 0).

 Donâ€™t read numbers following the number 0.

 Sample Input 1:
 1
 7
 9
 0
 5

 Sample Output 1:
 3
